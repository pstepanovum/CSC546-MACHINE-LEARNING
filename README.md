# CSC546: Introduction to Machine Learning with Applications

## Course Overview
CSC546 is an comprehensive introduction to Machine Learning, covering a wide range of topics in both unsupervised and supervised learning techniques. The course emphasizes practical applications, utilizing popular Python packages such as sklearn, PyTorch, and Keras for hands-on development.

## Key Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, students will:
- Master fundamental ML algorithms including K-means, PCA, KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM/SVR, and Neural Networks
- Gain proficiency in ensemble learning strategies
- Develop practical skills in implementing machine learning applications using Python

## Course Structure
The curriculum is divided into two main parts:
1. Classical Machine Learning: Covering traditional algorithms and concepts
2. Deep Neural Networks: Exploring advanced topics in deep learning

## Topics Covered
- Clustering algorithms (K-means, Gaussian Mixture Models)
- Dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, t-SNE)
- Classification and regression methods (Na√Øve Bayes, KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM)
- Ensemble learning (Random Forests)
- Neural Networks and Deep Learning
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Advanced DNN architectures (Autoencoders, GANs, Transformers)
- Transfer Learning and Model Robustness

## Assessment
- 5 Homework Assignments (400 points total)
  - Math problems
  - Programming projects using Python
- No formal exams (final project as 5th assignment)
- Class attendance (3% of final grade)

## Prerequisites
While not explicitly stated, a strong foundation in programming (especially Python) and basic statistical concepts is recommended.

## Textbooks
The course draws from multiple authoritative textbooks in the field, including:
- "The Elements of Statistical Learning" by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman
- "Machine Learning: a Probabilistic Perspective" by Murphy
- "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Bishop
- "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville

This course offers a blend of theoretical understanding and practical application, preparing students for both academic research and industry applications in the rapidly evolving field of machine learning.
